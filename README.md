## 🏗️ Client-Server Architecture Overview

- **Client-Side (Next.js):** Handles UI/UX, API communication, state management, and form validation using React Hook Form and Zod.  
- **Server-Side (Next.js API Routes):** Manages Plaid and Dwolla API interactions, data validation, business logic, and authentication.  
- **Plaid Integration:** Allows users to link bank accounts, securely exchanging tokens and fetching financial data.  
- **Dwolla Integration:** Handles ACH transfers, customer creation, and transaction status updates securely.  
- **Appwrite (Backend):** Provides authentication, database storage, file management, and real-time event handling.  
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secured via Appwrite’s authentication system using JWT tokens and session management.  
- **Data Management:** Stores user profiles, transactions, and financial insights in Appwrite’s secure database.  
- **Serverless Functions:** Executes custom backend logic such as notifications or data processing in real-time.  
- **Communication Workflow:** Integrates Appwrite, Plaid, and Dwolla for seamless account linking, fund transfers, and real-time updates.  
- **Scalable & Secure:** Modular, scalable architecture ensures performance, data integrity, and secure transactions.

## 🛜 CI/CD Pipeline with Vercel

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Every push to the GitHub repository triggers automatic builds on Vercel to ensure that the code compiles correctly and passes all defined tests.  
- **Automated Builds:** Vercel detects changes in the main branch (or other branches) and automatically builds the Next.js application with the latest updates.  
- **Preview Deployments:** For each pull request, Vercel creates a unique preview URL, allowing developers to test changes in a production-like environment before merging.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Once changes are merged into the main branch, Vercel automatically deploys the latest version of the application to production.  
- **Environment Variables Management:** Securely manages environment variables (e.g., API keys for Appwrite, Plaid, Dwolla) through Vercel’s dashboard for seamless deployment. 
- **Atomic Deployments:** Ensures zero-downtime deployments by replacing the entire application in production only after the new version is fully built and validated.  
- **Rollback Mechanism:** Provides an easy rollback option to quickly revert to previous deployments in case of issues with the latest release.  
- **Custom Domains & SSL:** Automatically manages custom domain configurations and ensures HTTPS with SSL certificates for secure deployments.  
- **Performance Monitoring:** Offers real-time analytics on build duration, deployment status, and application performance for continuous optimization.  
- **Git Integration:** Direct integration with GitHub ensures smooth collaboration, with every commit triggering the pipeline automatically.
